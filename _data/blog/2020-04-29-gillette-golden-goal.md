Gillette launches Golden Goal campaign and turns Neymar Jr.'s goals in support of his institute.

One of the biggest names in world football today, Neymar Jr. is known to be a relentless striker in front of goalkeepers. From now on, however, each goal scored by the striker will not only help his team to win, but will also mean even more for children, adolescents and families served by Instituto Neymar Jr., a charity created by the player in Praia Grande, SÃ£o Paulo.

Gillette launches the campaign Golden Goal, which aims to revert in resources to the Institute the achievements made during the athlete's precision journey in search of victories. By december 2016, each ball that Neymar Jr. put in the bottom of the net will be transformed into a golden ball that will symbolize the resources invested in Instituto projeto Neymar Jr.

The action aims to revert the funds in training workshops and expansion of activities to accommodate even more participants on site - either through barber training (at an exclusive Gillette barbershop that will be built on site), training of sports instructors, lessons on american football, construction of medical areas, recreation or expansion of night projects with relatives of children through sports.

For the INJR, receiving the financial benefit that will be used in the preparation and implementation of projects aimed at children and families served is a great opportunity.

With the inclusion of gillette within the framework of partners of the Institute, together with actions that the company will provide for the people who are benefited here, the social project only has to grow and provide new experiences.
