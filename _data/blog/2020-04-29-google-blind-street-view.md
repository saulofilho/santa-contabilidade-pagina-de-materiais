Google Creative Sandbox is a space to celebrate the intersection of creativity and technology, primarily within the realm of advertising.

It's a place for Google to expose cool creations, generate inspiration, and prompt possibilities. And below you are gonna enjoy my project, did it in 2011, with my great fellas Renato Simon and MÃ¡rcio Bento.

The idea was an app that helps people with visual impairment to move around the city using google tools this project was created for the first Google Creative Sandbox Awards in 2012.
