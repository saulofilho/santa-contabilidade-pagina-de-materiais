## Real stories of Real drivers.

Brazil was the first one in latam to launch a driver integrated campaign ever as a digital part, and we used driver stories to spread the message about our concept: "A Different Way".

For this campaign, we have some moments to highlight: functional and emotional.



Functional: the driver is the hero. He commands his life, please note that the driver interacts directly with the camera. In this case, we avoid to show passengers, cause the main focus will be on driver life.

Emotional: photos exploring daily situations that explain the reason why each people is the Uber partner driver. For all shooting, we decided to use warmer tones, cause is more familiar and trustable.
