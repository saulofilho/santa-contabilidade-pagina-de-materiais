## XC90's new feature: pedestrian and cyclist detection.

This technology detects pedestrians and cyclists on the road ahead, whether they are stationary or moving into your path if you donâ€™t respond to a warning your volvo will brake for you, which can lessen â€“ or avoid â€“ an impact.

## Well, we did a game as well. ðŸ‘¾ 



We took the print campaign to digital, by launching an instagram game called "Where is the Pedestrian?" users were challenged to do the same thing Volvo XC90 does: detect pedestrians but these pedestrians were specific ones we began by hiding Volvo's Brazil main influencer (Klebber Toledo) in our Instagram collage after users found him, they were then challenged to find the other 7 mystic figures we inserted can you find them?
